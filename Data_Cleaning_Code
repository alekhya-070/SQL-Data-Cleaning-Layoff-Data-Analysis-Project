-- Title: Layoffs 2022 Data Cleaning

-- Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022

-- Step 1: Create a staging table for cleaning purposes
CREATE TABLE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging 
LIKE world_layoffs.layoffs;

INSERT layoffs_staging 
SELECT * FROM world_layoffs.layoffs;

-- Step 2: Remove duplicates
WITH DELETE_CTE AS (
    SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions, 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions) AS row_num
    FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
)
DELETE FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
WHERE (company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions, row_num) IN (
    SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions, row_num
    FROM DELETE_CTE
) AND row_num > 1;

-- Step 3: Standardize data
UPDATE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
SET industry = NULL
WHERE industry = '';

UPDATE layoffs_staging2 t1
JOIN layoffs_staging2 t2
ON t1.company = t2.company
SET t1.industry = t2.industry
WHERE t1.industry IS NULL
AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET industry = 'Crypto'
WHERE industry IN ('Crypto Currency', 'CryptoCurrency');

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET country = TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM country);

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET `date` = STR_TO_DATE(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y');

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
MODIFY COLUMN `date` DATE;

-- Step 4: Handle null values and clean up data
DELETE FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
DROP COLUMN row_num;

SELECT * FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;
